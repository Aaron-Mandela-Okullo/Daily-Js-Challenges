# Daily-Js-Challenges
JavaScript Beginner Challenge: 5-Day Series

## Welcome to the JavaScript Challenge!
This 5-day series is designed to strengthen your understanding of JavaScript by focusing on array methods, ES6 features, event listeners, and DOM manipulation. Each day consists of three challenges that gradually build on what you’ve learned.

## How to Participate


### Fork the Repository:

Go to the GitLab repo and click the "Fork" button to create your own copy.
If you prefer GitHub, you can clone the repo and push it to your GitHub account.



### Set Up Your Environment:

Clone your forked repository to your local machine using git clone <your-repo-url>.
Navigate into the project folder with cd your-repo-folder.
Open the project in your favorite code editor.



## Daily Challenges:

Each day, you'll find three challenges in the day-x folder (replace x with the day number).
Complete each challenge by writing your solution in the corresponding script.js file.



### Submit Your Work:

After completing the challenges for the day, commit your changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Completed Day x Challenges"
git push origin main



Create a merge request (MR) on GitLab or a pull request (PR) on GitHub for review.



### Need Help?

If you get stuck, feel free to reach out by creating an issue on your repo or in the main repo.




## Day 1: Array Methods


### Challenge 1: Array Map

Use the map() method to create a new array that doubles each number in the original array.
Example: [1, 2, 3] → [2, 4, 6]




### Challenge 2: Array Filter

Use the filter() method to create a new array with only the even numbers.
Example: [1, 2, 3, 4] → [2, 4]




### Challenge 3: Array Reduce

Use the reduce() method to find the sum of all numbers in the array.
Example: [1, 2, 3, 4] → 10





## Day 2: ES6 Features


### Challenge 1: Arrow Functions

Convert a regular function into an arrow function.
Example: function add(a, b) { return a + b; } → const add = (a, b) => a + b;




### Challenge 2: Spread Operator

Use the spread operator to merge two arrays into one.
Example: [1, 2] and [3, 4] → [1, 2, 3, 4]




### Challenge 3: Destructuring

Use destructuring to extract values from an object and array.
Example: const {name, age} = {name: 'John', age: 30};





## Day 3: Event Listeners


### Challenge 1: Click Event

Add an event listener that logs a message when a button is clicked.



### Challenge 2: Mouseover Event

Add an event listener that changes the color of a div when the mouse hovers over it.



### Challenge 3: Keydown Event

Add an event listener that logs the key pressed by the user.




## Day 4: DOM Manipulation


### Challenge 1: Create an Element

Create a new p element with some text and append it to the body.



### Challenge 2: Modify an Element

Change the text content of an existing h1 element when a button is clicked.



### Challenge 3: Remove an Element

Remove an existing div from the DOM when a specific key is pressed.




## Day 5: Putting It All Together


### Challenge 1: Dynamic List

Create a list from an array of items and display it on the page.



### Challenge 2: Form Validation

Create a simple form with validation. Show an error message if the input is empty.



### Challenge 3: Interactive Card

Create a card that flips to reveal more information when clicked.




### Submitting the Final Challenge
On Day 5, after completing all challenges, push your code and submit your final merge/pull request for review. We’ll provide feedback and suggestions on your work.

Good luck, and enjoy the challenge! Don’t hesitate to ask questions along the way.
